                Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you
                have already given at any time. An informal e-mail notification to us is sufficient for this purpose.
                The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the
                revocation.

                For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or
                inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can
                recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from
                "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

              <p className="mt-2">This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                The basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO, which permits the processing of data for
                the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.

              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                The processing of the data entered in the contact form is therefore based exclusively on your consent
                (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke this consent at any time. An informal e-mail to us is
                sufficient for this purpose. The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the
                revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke
                your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g., after we have
                completed processing your request). Mandatory legal provisions - especially retention periods - remain
                unaffected.
